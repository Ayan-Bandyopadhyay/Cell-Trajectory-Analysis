Cell-Trajectory-Analysis
========================

##Synopsis
**Cell-Trajectory-Analysis** is a set of functions for cell tracking and biological trajectory analysis, to be used on video
taken with fluorescence microscopy. This functions can be used to threshold video to detect cells marked with green fluorescence protein, generate trajectories for each cell, quantify each trajectory, and classify each trajectory using the k-nearest neighbors statistical learning model. This package is dependent on two other packages, namely flowcatchR and traj.
